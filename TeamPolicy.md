# Team Policy

#### Roles

The roles for this team is as follows: The _coordinator_ is Thiha, the _monitor_ will be Youran and finally, Nick will be the the _checker_.

#### Meeting Times

The meeting place will be located at school, and the time for it will be during the one lab time per week assigned for team work. If not in person, we can host another meeting virtually during the weekend, a moment where the whole group is free and able to put time to work. It can also be during the week if it is urgent. A "guide-lin" schedule can be found in MeetingLogs.md in the meetings branch.

#### Working Times

The common time to work on the project for the weekdays is after 6pm, meaning right after school. Since most of us will be home by then, it will be a good time to work and communicate to each other if a problem arises. You are expected to be able to usually be able to find another memeber working on the project around this time when teamwork is needed.

#### Use Of Gitlab for communication

We will make sure to use the issues tab on Gitlab, as a way to tell each other what we are working on, what needs to be fixed or what is finished. Using Gitlab will make it clear on what each teammate is doing without explicitly saying anything. It is important to check this tab often to know what to do for the project. Comments that provide details / feedback will be common practice.

#### Delay of response

We are often connected to the Internet easily, so the delay for responses will be 12 hours. Even if something isn't answered through Discord, we can ask each other in class the next day if needed.

#### In case of 'problems'

In case of an issue, always communicate to the other teammates about said problem through Discord (Main place of communication). We can always find a solution. If there is a disagreement within the team since we are 3 one member can always serve as mediator and help come to a solution. However if the disagreement is particularily big then we could consult the manager ( Maya ) and find a solution/intervention.

#### Team expectations

We will all put effort into making this a good project, making it so we all deserve the grade we are going to get.

When a meeting happens, we will all show up on time, and leave at an appropriate time as well.

We will try our best to answer a question if one of us has one and to find a solution.

We will be supporting each other when one of us feels overwhelmed, so we can finish strong together.

When one of us encounters a problem that will affect their performance, they will inform the rest of the team.

When a disagreement happens, we will have to resolve it within ourselves unless its is extremely problematic.

We will not finish out work too last minute ( example: 21 commits at 11:30 ).
